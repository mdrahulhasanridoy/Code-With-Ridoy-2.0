### Question 1

```
Write a C program to take two integers as input and show who is bigger. If they are equal print as it is. See the sample input output for more clarification.
```
| Sample Input | Sample Output  |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| 5 10         | B is bigger    |
| 10 2         | A is bigger    |
| 4 4          | They are equal |

### Question 2

```
Write a C program to take three integers as input and show who is bigger. If they are equal print as it is. See the sample input output for more clarification.
```
| Sample Input | Sample Output  |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| 5   10  4    | B is bigger    |
| 10  2   5    | A is bigger    |
| 4   4   7    | C is bigger    |
| 10  10  10   | They are equal |

```
Bonus Task, try if you can do this also
```
| Sample Input | Sample Output           |
| ------------ | ----------------------- |
| 2  10  10    | B and C both are bigger |
| 5   3   5    | A and C both are bigger |
| 7   7   5    | A and B both are bigger |

### Question 3

```
Write a C program to take one non-negative integer as input and check if it is even or odd.
```
| Sample Input | Sample Output |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| 5            | Odd           |
| 8            | Even          |

### Question 4

```
Write a C program to take one non-negative integer as input and print the grade according to that input. The grade system is shown below

0-32-> F 

33-39-> D 

40-49 -> C

50-59-> B

60-69 -> A-

70-79-> A 

80-100-> A+
```
| Sample Input | Sample Output |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| 65           | A-            |
| 79           | A             |
| 95           | A+            |
| 19           | F             |


### Question 5

```
Write a C program to take three non-negative integers as input and tell if it forms a valid triangle. A triangle is valid if sum of its two sides is greater than the third side. Print YES or NO. All sides must be valid (greater than 0).
```

| Sample Input | Sample Output |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| 2  4  2      | NO            |
| 6  3  2      | YES           |
| 0  2 10      | NO            |
| 4  2  8      | YES           |

### Question 6

```
You have got X marks in your exam. As you are a good and regular student, if you ask your teacher he/she can give you at most Y bonus marks. Now you need to tell if you take bonus marks will your number became 100? 

Write a C program to take two non-negative integers X and Y as input and print YES or NO.
```

| Sample Input | Sample Output |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| 95   10      | YES           |
| 80    5      | NO            |
